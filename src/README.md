# Nix tribe docs

## What we do

The nix tribe is a group of people trying to make their projects and setups reproducible, with the goal to reduce project setup effort to zero and use the advantages of infrastructure as code. We do this with different tools and to varying degrees. Such tools include NixOS, nix-darwin, Home-Manager, project flakes and more. What they have in common is the nix package manager and the nix language.

## How we do it

We collaborate to reach productivity as fast as possible, so we can make the nix setup our daily driver and learn while we work. To make it easier for everyone, and since documentation is one of the weak spots of the fast-moving nix community, we document what we learned here. Every member of the tribe is highly welcome to extend this documentation. For each change, a PR will be created, peer reviewed, and then merged. We'll figure out how to best organize this as we go.

Particularly interesting will be to find out which parts of the docs will be common to everyone, and which only apply to subgroups, such as people using [NixOS](./ecosystem-tools/nixos) and such that use [nix-darwin](./ecosystem-tools/nix-darwin/).

In order to ensure high quality and structure, documentation and nix files will be assigned [maintainers](./ecosystem-tools/maintainers.md), which will review PRs concerning their subtopics and bundle expertise.

We intend to share this knowledge amongst each other and build blueprints and best practices to manage our tech-stacks and projects. This repository will document who has expertise in which areas by means of git blame, so it's easy to find competent help. Collaboration is key.
